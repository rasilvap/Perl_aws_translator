# Perl_aws_translator
Rest Api to use the AWS Translator service 

### Quick guide to run the service locally
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
* Have an [Aws account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Set up AWS IAM identity Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KhrGFV_Npw) 

## Steps
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rasilvap/Perl_aws_translator.git
    ```
2.  ### Dockerfile for Perl Application with AWS cli Paws and Dancer2
    This Dockerfile provides an environment to run a Perl application based on Dancer2 that utilizes AWS and requires JSON, Paws, and AWS CLI dependencies. Additionally, a step-by-step guide is included to set up AWS credentials and run      the application on a new machine.

       #### Steps:
    
            Configure AWS Credentials
                Before running the application, ensure you configure AWS credentials. Set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variables with your AWS credentials in the DockerFile: 
                AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
                AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
                AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token
                
            Build and run the Docker image:
           
                docker build -t my-perl-app .
            
                docker run -p 3000:3000 my-perl-app .
    
       #### Notes:
            Make sure to replace your-access-key, your-secret-key, and your-session-token with your actual AWS credentials. This command is suitable for applications that require AWS credentials
            to run, the token duration is one hour, after this time you need to update the credentials to run the app, you can use the next command:
            docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token -p 3000:3000 my-perl-app.

            In order to update your credentials, you would need to do a aws sso login  --profile <profile-name> and to refresh your credentials and then update them in the ./awas/credentials file.
            You can use aws configure list-profiles to know you current profile.
            Then sign in to the IAM Identity center.
            The format of the URL is https://d-xxxxxxxxxx.awsapps.com/startor your_subdomain.awsapps.com/start and then go to the AWS Account/Command line programmatic access and reeplace
            the new credentials in you env vars, in the above docker command.
            
4. Test the service, open Postman and import the file:  
   >  Perl-Aws-Translator.postman_collection.json
